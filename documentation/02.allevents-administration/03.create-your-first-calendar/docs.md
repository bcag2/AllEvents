All Allevents features have a common basis: the calendar concept. An event is linked to a calendar. The "Museum visit" will be part of the "Visit" calendar while the "Meeting" event could be part of the "club life" calendar, the "Summer internship" part of a "Our children" calendar.  
You could decide that you should need only one calendar on your website and that this “calendar concept” is not mandatory. No problem! An event is not linked in a mandatory way to a calendar and you couldn’t care.
However, as nobody knows how your website can envolve, I advise you to create a calendar in order to be ready the day you would need. By creating a calendar since the beginning, your events and other AllEvents data will already be on the right way and it will simplify the multi-calendar enhancement.

Log into administration website in order to create a calendar. Then go to AllEvents menu. Click on ![](agendas.png)
