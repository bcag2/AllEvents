In many cases, it's practical to create more than one AllEvents menu item, each with different sets of events being displayed.

Some examples include:

* Different menu items linking directly to different AllEvents views (Monthly View, Map View, etc...)
* Different menu items displaying events from different calendars
* Different menu items displaying events from different venues
* Seperate menu item to display a users personal calendar (i.e. with only their private events)
* Seperate menu item for creating new events

To create a menu item for your main menu:
1. In the Joomla administrative back end, go to **Menus >> Main Menu >> Add New Menu Item** 
2. You will see "Menus: New Item" administrative page. Click Select and Click on your desired menu type:
