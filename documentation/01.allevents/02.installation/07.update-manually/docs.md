Sometime, you might need to update to latest version manually (for example, when Joomla Update doesn't work). In this case, login to your account on our website, then access to My Downloads menu item [https://www.allevents3.com](https://www.allevents3.com), download latest version of the extension from there. Then install that latest version in the same way as new installation.
