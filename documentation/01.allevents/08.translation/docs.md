## AllEvents enhances its linguistic features

To have a component in english language is mandatory for every Joomla developer. We often add our native language that provides two language packs. The community using your component  proposes it naturally.

That happened for AllEvents translation for our Belgium friends. 

## AllEvents is an international project

AllEvents is an international project and its translations stayed up to now limited. Why didn't we up to now deployed more languages?  Now as the development of new versions and improvements is in progress, we take advantage of this work to focus on the translation.

Thanks to a huge work performed by [Franck Joris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frank-joris-0026b619), we can now provide AllEvents in Dutch - French and Flemish.

!!! Translators, we need you
